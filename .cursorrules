# SIEMply Project Rules

# General Project Rules
- All code must follow the project structure defined in siemply.md
- All commits should reference a task ID (e.g., "task-api-host-management: Implemented host CRUD operations")
- Always follow security best practices, especially for SSH and credential handling
- Always fix code in main codebase, not create any fix scripts

# File Structure Rules
- API endpoints must be in backend/api/
- SSH automation logic must be in backend/automation/
- Installer scripts must be in backend/installers/
- Frontend components must be in frontend/components/
- Database models must be in backend/models/
- Tests must be in respective backend/tests/ or frontend/tests/ directories

# Environment Configuration
- Never hardcode secrets or configuration
- Always use .env files or environment variables for configuration
- Use a consistent naming convention for environment variables (e.g., SIEMPLY_DB_URI)
- Configure customizable ports for both frontend (UI) and backend (API) services

# Linting and Code Quality
- Run linters before committing code (eslint for frontend, flake8 for backend)
- Fix all TypeScript errors before deploying frontend code
- Maintain 100% type coverage in TypeScript files
- Run tests to ensure code quality
